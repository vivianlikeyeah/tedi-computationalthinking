						<b>What are algorithms?</b>
						<br>
						One of your classmates at TEDI London has asked you for help with Pattern Recognition Example 3.
						This was a breeze for you, so you say no worries. However, when you take a look at the question,
						you realise those pesky tutors have given each student a slightly different room layout – meaning
						you can’t just give your friend the answer. You’ll have to teach them how to do it. 
						<br><br>
						How would you explain it to them? (Remember what we taught you in our decomposition pages)
						<br><br>
						<b>Step 1:</b> Let one table = 2 chairs, so let’s say t = 2 chairs.<br>
						<b>Step 2:</b> Count the number of tables in the first row, let’s call this r1.<br>
						<b>Step 3:</b> Count the number of rows in the room, let’s call this rT.<br>
						<b>Step 4:</b> Multiply r1 and rT and t.
						<br><br>
						Congratulations. You’ve written an algorithm. This algorithm can be sent to every student at TEDI,
						and can be applied to any basic room layout (no matter any variation of r1 or rT). That’s the power
						of algorithms. They can be re-used, re-applied, and are therefore incredibly efficient. 
						<br><br>
						<b><u>Modification:</u></b> TEDI London is in high demand. We now need to fit more students in the
						same space. Your tutor tells you that one table can now sit 3 chairs. How many steps in your algorithm
						needs to change to accommodate for this?
						<br><br>
						<b>How do I write an algorithm?</b>
						<br>
						Consider the following questions. Where do I start? Where do I want to end? What happens in between?
						<br><br>
						In order to determine what happens in between we should consider what you learnt in
						<a href="decomposition/index.html">decomposition</a> and <a href="pattern_recognition.html">pattern 
						recognition</a>. How can we break down a large overwhelming problem into smaller bite sized chunks? How
						do I recognise patterns to both solve my problems, and develop efficient code? Once that is done, the
						final step of constructing an algorithm is determining the order in which all these steps come together.
						<br><br>
						<b>Why is order important?</b>
						<br>
						One of the most important concepts in writing an algorithm following decomposition and pattern recognition
						is determining the order in which the steps come together. 
						<br><br>
						The basic example that is often given is when you consider addition and subtraction.<br>
						1 + 5 = 6 and 5 + 1 = 6. The order here does not matter. However, in the case of subtraction 5 – 1 = 4 and
						1 – 5 = -4. Order clearly has a significant impact on the outcome. 
						<br><br>	
						<b><u>Exercise:</u></b><br>
						<b>a)</b> Name a mathematical operation where order does not matter<br>
						<b>b)</b> Name a mathematical operation where order does matter.<br>
						<b>c)</b> Sometimes the impact of order can be subtler.<br><br>
						Let’s consider the following basic maths:<br><br>
						You are going to provide a set of instructions for your friend to solve a problem. Your friend completes
						one step at a time. So you tell them step 1, they complete step 1. You tell them step 2, they complete
						step 2 and so on. They don’t know what step 3 is when they are completing step 2, and they don’t ask
						because they have blind faith in you. 
						<br><br>
						<b>Instruction Set A</b><br>
						Step 1. Let a= 654<br>
						Step 2. Let b= 678<br>
						Step 3. a + b<br>
						So your friend would calculate the following,<br>
						a = 654<br>
						b= 678<br>
						a+b=1332 <br>
						<br><br>
						Let’s try again with a different instruction set<br>
						<br>
						<b>Instruction Set B</b><br>
						Step 1. Let b= 678<br>
						Step 2. Let a = 654<br> 
						Step 3. b + a<br> 
						So your friend would calculate the following:<br>
						b= 678<br>
						a = 654<br>
						b+a=1332<br>
						<br>
						<b>Instruction Set C</b>
						Step 1. Let a= 654<br> 
						Step 2. b + a<br>
						Step 3. Let b = 678<br>
						<br>
						When your friend follows your instructions the following happens:<br>
						a = 654<br>
						Friend Crashes.<br>
						<div class="md-form">
							<label for="form1">
								Why was your friend unable to carry out the instructions this time?
							</label>
							<textarea id="form1" class="md-textarea form-control" rows="3"></textarea>
						</div>
						<br>
						<span id="tbr-hidden">
							<b>Solution:</b><br> 
							They were told to calculate a + b, but they didn’t know what b was yet. 
							<br><br>
							The order in which we give instructions is very important, and therefore the order in
							which we write our algorithms is very important. In some cases they don’t matter. But
							sometimes, even subtle differences that may not seem like a big deal can cause a total
							crash. 
							<br><br>
							<b>Research Assignment (20 minutes)</b><br>
							Find an example of the coolest algorithm you can think of. How does it work?
							<br><br>
							<b>Basic Algorithm Question (10 minutes)</b><br>
							In September 2004, the show Wife Swap aired. On this show, two wives swapped lives. They
							were given a manual as to how to run the household in the exact same way as the previous
							wife. This manual was essentially an algorithm. 
							<br><br>
							Select a task that you perform daily and write an algorithm to solve it. One that can be
							passed onto anyone else. Remember to use the principles of decomposition and pattern recognition.
